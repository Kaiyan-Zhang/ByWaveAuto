# ByWaveAuto
## What is ByWave
ByWave is a good GFW-breaker, 
but the process of setup the proxy is too annoying, 
so I made this to automatically click the buttons. 
## Dependencies & Platform
ByWaveAuto is based on AutoHotKey, which is a extremely powerful auto-tool running on Windows. 
## How to use
- Add the ByWave.exe to your PATH, you can just press Win+I then search "path"
- Run the release file
- Press Ctrl+I to auto-start the "global-America-Cogent" proxy
- Press Ctrl+K to stop the proxy
- Press Ctrel+U to check if you need to toggle the Windows proxy
## Everything is customizable
- Download and install the AutoHotKey from their official website, 
- Right-click the *.ahk file then choose "edit script"
- Right-click the *.ahk file then choose "Run script" or "Compile scipt"
